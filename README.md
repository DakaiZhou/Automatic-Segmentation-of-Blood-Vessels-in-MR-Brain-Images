# Automatic-Segmentation-of-Blood-Vessels-in-MR-Brain-Images
This is my master thesis project, which aims to automatically segment carotid from MR brain image, and use the segmented carotid to extract Time-Activity-Curve from PET images. It mainly involves 3D image coregistration, vessel segmentation, partial valume correction.
